		<h3><strong>Taekwondo</strong></h3>
			<p>Taekwondo is originally a Korean martial art, where both hand and foot techniques are used. The literal translation of the word Taekwondo is: "The way of the foot and the fist". </p>
			<p class="spacelines">The word Taekwondo is made up of 3 parts:</p>

			<p class="spacelines"><strong>Tae (foot):</strong> The foot represents all leg techniques such as kicking and jumping.</p>

			<p class="spacelines"><strong>Kwon (fist):</strong> The hand stands for all hand and arm techniques such as bumps, blocks, gripping, clamping and throwing.</p>

			<p class="spacelines"><strong>Do (the way):</strong> The road is the path that you follow while practicing Taekwondo and mainly represents the mental part.</p>


			<p class="spacelines">Whichever branch of martial art you choose with <a href="https://www.taekwon.nl/taekwondo/" id="linkreferral"><strong>HWA-RANG Taekwondo</strong></a>, they always strive for a balanced curriculum full of challenges. The more balanced the challenge, the more fun it is to continue! You can flow in whenever you want, at any level!
